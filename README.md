# Split Scope
As we expand our features we hope to offer a more robust experience for users who are looking to split their scope of work across their repositories.

## About

This project is aimed at streamlining task and team management. It provides a more user forward experience for managing Github issues, milestones, and projects. 

Currently in a closed beta. Open beta will be announced soon!

Organizations can join and link their repositories allowing themselves and their members to view all current projects nad milestones. Members can chat with other members and team leads can organize tasks based on available time for all members. Any person assigned an issue for a project can update time worked and automatically have PRs linked to deployments
